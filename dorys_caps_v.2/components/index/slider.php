                    <p>Autumn, also known as fall in North American English, is one of the four temperate
                        seasons. Outside the tropics, autumn marks the transition from summer to winter,
                        in September or March. Autumn is the season when the duration of daylight becomes
                        noticeably shorter and the temperature cools considerably.</p>

                    <p>Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate zones. It occurs
                        between autumn and spring.The tilt of Earth's axis causes seasons; winter occurs
                        when a hemisphere is oriented away from the Sun. Different cultures define different
                        dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather.</p>

                    <p>Summer is the hottest of the four temperate seasons, occurring after spring and
                        before autumn. At or aroundthe summer solstice, the earliest sunrise and latest
                        sunset occurs, daylight hours are longest and dark hours are shortest, with day
                        length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice.</p>

                    <p>Spring, also known as springtime, is one of the four temperate seasons, succeeding
                        winter and preceding summer. There are various technical definitions of spring, but
                        local usage of the term varies according to local climate, cultures and customs. When
                        it is spring in the Northern Hemisphere, it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere and
                        vice versa.</p>
